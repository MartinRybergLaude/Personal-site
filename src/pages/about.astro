  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>Greetings! I'm a Swedish frontend developer based in Stockholm.</p>
  <section>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
      I mostly work in Typescript using React, with frameworks such as Next.js
      and Astro to cover a wide variety of site types. I also have experience
      with Node.js, GraphQL, and a bit of Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work well both solo and in a team, and prefer using team-oriented tools
      and patterns for all my work. This includes quality version control, time
      tracking and project boards.
